# Adaptive Learning and Online Compensation-based Attitude Control for a QUAV with Load Uncertainty (Under Review)
### Experiment videos under the proposed attitude tracking control of a QUAV with load uncertainty
To verify the control performances of the BLC scheme, attitude tracking experiments are implemented by a QUAV. The QUAV is firmly fixed on a rotatable column to restrict its translational movement and is connected below to a load composed of two cylindrical containers partially filled with liquid. The comparative results demonstrate the BLC scheme achieves superior attitude control performance and lower control cost.
